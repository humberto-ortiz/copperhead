Build julia on ROCKS:

make -j 4 OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH=NEHALEM OPENBLAS_NO_AVX2=1

otherwise you get no such instruction errors.

test.jl generates a random sequence.

LightTable + Juno is a nice editor for Julia. Can evaluate expressions in the
editor and annotate the output.

Had to remove ~/.julia and reinstall Julia 0.3.1 to get IJulia working.

ipython notebook --profile=julia

now works too. See copperhead-test.ipynb.

graph-test and keyvertex-test are simple examples of graph manipulation I
grabbed from the internet.

I think I have to build a Dict from kmers to vertices to store vertices.
